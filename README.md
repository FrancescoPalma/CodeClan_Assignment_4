# :iphone:  Swift Project 
  
This is my last Solo Project at CodeClan, Cohort3.  
We are free to choose any particular technology we'd like to learn, so I have decided to take this opportunity to learn the basics of Swift and iOS development and try to make a simple Focus App.  
At the end of the week we will make a 15-mins presentation on what we have learnt during the week, the challenges, the obstacles, what we enjoyed the most, etc.

**Time:** From Friday 20/05/16 to Thursday 26/05/16  
  
**Requirements for MVP:**  
- The user can tap on :arrow_forward: to fire up the timer
- The user can tap on the 'pause' button to stop the timer
- The app advises the user against pausing the timer as the purpose of the app is to help the user focus on their activities
- As soon as the 'pause' button is tapped, an animated gif will be launched on the screen as the user is not supposed to pause his activity
- If the user pauses the timer, the following session will be starting from the beginning and not when the user paused
- If the user ends successfully a focus session an animated gif will be launched on the screen as a 'reward' for the commitment
- A circular, colourful progress bar is present for the user
- The progress bar runs a full lap every second
